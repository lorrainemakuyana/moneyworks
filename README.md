# Money works 

#### CS341 Web Technologies Final Project
Money works is a system designed to help individuals keep track of their physical money and help 
calculate investment profits/losses daily. It provides a bank-like wallet system that enables 
a user to specify all their income and expenditure for any money they have withdrawn from the bank, 
with, of course, a little user engagement and some little time devotion.

### Functionality Displayed 
Moneyworks, which is a simple proof of concept, or rather an MVP of the whole idea, enables 
a user to do the following CRUD operations:- 
* Create an account
* Login to user account 
* View all expenses and investments (Read)
* Add, remove, delete an expense 
* Add, remove, delete an investment
* Update user balance directly or by removing an expense they mistakenly added
* Change user password
