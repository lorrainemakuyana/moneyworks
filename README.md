# Money works 

#### CS341 Web Technologies Final Project
Money works is a system designed to help individuals keep track of their physical money and help 
calculate investment profits/losses over time. It provides a bank-like wallet system that enables 
you to specify all your income and expenditure for any money you have withdrawn from the bank, 
with, of course, a little user engagement and some little time devotion.
