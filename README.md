## Money works 
Money works is a system designed to help everything keep track of their physical money and help 
calculate investment profits/losses over time. It provides a bank-like wallet system that enables 
you to specify all your income and expenditure for any money the user has withdrawn from the bank through, 
with, of course, a little user engagement.
